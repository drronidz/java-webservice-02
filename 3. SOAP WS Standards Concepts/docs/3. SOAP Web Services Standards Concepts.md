## SOAP Web Services Security Introduction
One of the biggest advantages of SOAP web services over RESTfull web services is the existence of 
**WS-STANDARDS** 

**Why WS-STANDARDS ?**

* Authentication: The process of exchanging email (username) & password & making sure of the identity. Ways
of implementing Authentication:
   * Username Token Profile.
   * X 509 Certificates.
   * SAML (Single Sign on).
* Confidentiality: The process of **Encrypting/Decrypting** the exchanged data between Client & Provider in
order to prevent hackers to know the content of data.
* Integrity: Ensuring that the data sent from the client side is the same on the provider side & preventing
the hackers from adding random stuffs to the exchanged data (done via **Signatures**).example:
calculating the hash on the client side (recalculate it on the server side).
**Note:** the hash is part of the data. 
* Non Repudiation: The process of preventing the provider from **Replay Attacks** (via TIME STAMP).
